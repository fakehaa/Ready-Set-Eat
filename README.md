# Ready Set Eat

This project aims to answer the question "What would you like to eat today?" or "What should I make today?" We tried to answer this question by creating RSE (Ready. Set. Eat). 

RSE works in a two-part project. 
The first part is a Yolov8 ðŸš€ based detection model. This detects all ingredients either raw or packaged, that exists in someones pantry or fridge.
